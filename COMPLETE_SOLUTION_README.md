```

## 🔐 Visibility System

### How It Works:
1. Each field has a visibility level in `data_field_visibility` table
2. `SurveyViewer` checks user role before showing fields
3. Fields are filtered automatically

### Example:
```
Field: "email_address"
Visibility: "admin"
Result: Only admins see this field

Field: "fund_name"
Visibility: "public"
Result: Everyone sees this field

Field: "target_fund_size"
Visibility: "member"
Result: Members and admins see this field
```
